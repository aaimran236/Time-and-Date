# Time-and-Date
Date-and-Time is an Android application developed in Java using Android Studio. The app displays the current time using  "24-hour clock" time notation ( hh:mm:ss) and date in full-screen mode, inspired by the [TimeandDate.com full-screen clock](https://www.timeanddate.com). It keeps the phone display on while operating.
