# Time and Date

Time and Date is an Android application developed in Java using Android Studio. The app displays the current time using  "24-hour clock" time notation ( hh:mm:ss) and date in full-screen mode, inspired by the [TimeandDate.com full-screen clock](https://www.timeanddate.com). It keeps the phone display on while operating.

## Features

- Displays current time in hours, minutes, and seconds(24-hour clock).
- Displays current date.
- Operates in full-screen mode.
- Keeps the phone display on while the app is running.
